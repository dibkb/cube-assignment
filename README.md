# Vite + TypeScript App

This guide will help you set up and run the Vite + TypeScript app locally using `pnpm`.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dibkb/cube-assignment.git
cd cube-assignment
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the project dependencies using `pnpm`

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Start the Development Server

Run the development server with

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server and open your application in the default web browser. By default, it should be available at http://localhost:5173/
